 # Abstract
 
Develop a tool to craft DNS packets and query DNS servers so the message could be passed along. 

These packets, carefully constructed, allow the encoding of messages. By querying a DNS server with these packets, 
the traditional domain resolution system is repurposed, serving as a covert medium for message transmission. However, 
ethical and legal considerations arise, as this unconventional use may pose security and privacy concerns.
